# Dots
My Arch linux configuration

will update readme later 

## Basic info
- lightdm (web-greeter + neon theme)
- custom patched DWM

<sub>and Czech keyboard :smrckaBat:</sub>

## Automatic installation (WIP!)
Run **autoinstall.sh** for automatic deployment. <br>
The script only deploys the config files and installs my preffered packages, <br>
it is meant to be run after Arch is fully installed, with network already set up. <br>
<br>
Make sure to run the script **as a user** and **from the directory** where it is located!
